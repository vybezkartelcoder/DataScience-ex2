# Stock Market Price Prediction

A data science project for predicting stock market prices using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock market prices by analyzing historical data and applying various machine learning techniques. The predictions can help investors make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

## Features

- Historical stock data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualization
- Feature engineering for time series data
- Implementation of multiple prediction models (LSTM, ARIMA, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Real-time prediction capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Collection

```bash
python src/data/collect_data.py --symbols AAPL MSFT GOOGL --start-date 2018-01-01
```

### Training Models

```bash
python src/models/train.py --model lstm --features open high low volume
```

### Making Predictions

```bash
python src/models/predict.py --model lstm --symbol AAPL --days 30
```

## Methodology

This project employs the following approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data is obtained from reliable financial APIs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Raw data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed for model consumption.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators and relevant features are derived from the raw data.
4. **Model Training**: Multiple models are trained on the processed data.
5. **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
6. **Deployment**: The best-performing model is selected for making predictions.

## Results

The project includes visualizations and performance metrics for different models:

- Time series plots of actual vs. predicted prices
- Error distribution analysis
- Feature importance assessment
- Model comparison charts

## Limitations

- Stock market prediction is inherently uncertain due to numerous external factors
- Models may not account for sudden market shifts due to global events
- Performance varies across different market conditions and stock types

## Future Work

- Incorporate sentiment analysis from news and social media
- Implement ensemble methods for improved prediction accuracy
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions
- Explore deep reinforcement learning approaches
